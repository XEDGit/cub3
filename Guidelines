TODO:
	- maybe move free_map from cub3.c to map.c

	- check multiple players on map at parsing


MANDATORY:

only 6 charachters:
	- 0 empty
	- 1 wall
	- N, S, E, W charachter spawn and orientation

the map must be closed		V

the name must end in ".cub"		V

the map must be at the end of the file		V

any other content than the map must ignore multiple newlines or spaces		V

spaces are valid part of the map, they can be handled as I want		V

LAST PROBLEMS:
	colors format, Fixed	V
	double specification for textures or color, Fixed	V
	trasparency of textures - should be fine, gotta discuss it
	to choose if we want to use 4 or 8 neighbours floodfill (map.c)
	map 1x1 makes segmentation fault when turning
	corners have very wonky collisions if you press two direction (not a real issue)
	the map left-to-right is inverted, any idea for an easy fix?
	variable size of textures (init.c)

Extra content:
	- NO path: path to texture facing north
	- SO path: path to texture facing south
	- WE path: path to texture facing west
	- EA path: path to texture facing east
	- F r,g,b: floor color in RGB in range 0-255 inclusive
	- C r,g,b: ceiling color in RGB in range 0-255 inclusive

BONUS:

wall collisions
minimap
doors to open and close
animated sprites
rotate view with mouse

EXTRA:

Enemies and combat (melee or shooting)
animated sprites based on entity status
Multiple maps with (end of levels || teleports between maps)
